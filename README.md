## Binary Search
When we search for an element using simple search, in the worst case we might have to look at every single element. So for a list of 8 numbers, we'd have to check 8 numbers at most. For binary search, we have to check log n elements in the worst case. For a list of 8 elements, log 8 == 3, because 2 cubed == 8. So for a list of 8 numbers, we would have to check 3 numbers at most. O(log n) => log time.
